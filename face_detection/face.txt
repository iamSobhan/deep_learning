Face detection in deep learning refers to the process of locating and identifying faces within images or video frames using deep neural networks. It is a fundamental task in computer vision and has numerous applications, such as facial recognition, emotion analysis, age estimation, and more. The goal of face detection is to identify the regions in an image that contain faces, often represented as bounding boxes, enabling further analysis or actions to be taken on these regions.
